# Grid Solver Robot

# Finalist at International Robotics Challenge (IRC) 2015

A grid-solver robot made for IRC 2014 and IRC 2015 that can map a grid containing objects, obstacles and bridges, calculate the shortest and easiest path and then navigate back while picking up certain objects. (Details are given on the problem statement)

Djisktra's Algorithm was used for calculating the shortest paths on the grid. (Check the videos for the demo)
